# Geometric Sector

## Description

Watch face inspired by the "WWII Sector Clock".
The coloured triangles help to see the time in different time zones.

You just have to identify the triangle that is the "12" for the desired time zone. Go right to UTC-x and left to UTC+x.

Then it is easy to see the other triangles in the same colour for hours 3, 6, and 9.

The fields are:

12th hour (blue circle): Moon age in days. Every moon lasts 29 days. 0 is the New Moon; 14 is Full Moon.

2nd hour: Day of week

3rd hour: Day of the month

6th hour: Steps during the day (x1000)

9th hour: Battery

Short yellow line: 30 minutes before today's sunrise to the sunrise itself

Small yellow circle: Minute of today's sunrise

Short red line: 30 minutes before today's sunset to the sunset itself

Small red circle: Minute of today's sunset

## What's New

Sun events are now a short line from the 30 minutes before the event to the event itself. The minute mark is still at the edge of the screen.

New hands.

Added the sun events, moon age, battery, steps, day, day of the week
